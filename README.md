# TL;DR

## What is this?

- This so called **Argon** is just a simple Notion clone that I made based on [Code With Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio)'s video, but there is a bit of adjustment just for *Vietnamese*, and it has an AI chat function.
- The live website is in the description. You can try it out.

## What can it do?

- ðŸ““ Take note, share note for friend.
- ðŸ¤– AI chat bot.

## Getting Started

**First**, clone the git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coder-Blue/argon-note.git
```

**Second**, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn install
#or
pnpm install
#or 
bun install
```

**Third**, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Before modifying my project, you should take a look into [Convex Docs](https://docs.convex.dev/home) and Edgestore to set up the database, [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to make the AI function works, and make a proper `.env.local` for the project.
